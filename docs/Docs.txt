/**
 * A UPnP discover request is an HTTP based request that uses the
 * Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) to discover UPnP devices.
 *
 * The following is taken from:
 *
 * http://www.upnp.org
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
 * HOST: 239.255.255.250:1900
 * MAN: "ssdp:discover"
 * MX: seconds to delay response
 * ST: search target
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Request line
 *
 * M-SEARCH
 * Method defined by SSDP for search requests.
 * Request applies generally and not to a specific resource. Must be *.
 *
 * HTTP/1.1
 * HTTP version.
 *
 * Headers:
 *
 * HOST
 * Required. Multicast channel and port reserved for SSDP by Internet Assigned
 * Numbers Authority (IANA). Must be 239.255.255.250:1900.
 *
 * MAN
 * Required. Unlike the NTS and ST headers, the value of the MAN header is
 * enclosed in double quotes. Must be "ssdp:discover".
 *
 * MX
 * Required. Maximum wait. Device responses should be delayed a random duration
 * between 0 and this many seconds to balance load for the control point when
 * it processes responses. This value should be increased if a large number of
 * devices are expected to respond or if network latencies are expected to be
 * significant. Specified by UPnP vendor. Integer.
 *
 * ST
 * Required header defined by SSDP. Search Target. Must be one of the following.
 * (cf. NT header in NOTIFY with ssdp:alive above.) Single URI.
 *
 * ssdp:all
 * Search for all devices and services.
 *
 * upnp:rootdevice
 * Search for root devices only.
 *
 * uuid:device-UUID
 * Search for a particular device. Device UUID specified by UPnP vendor.
 *
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:deviceType:v
 * Search for any device of this type. Device type and version defined by UPnP
 * Forum working committee.
 *
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:v
 * Search for any service of this type. Service type and version defined by
 * UPnP Forum working committee.

/**
 * A UPnP discover response is an HTTP based response to a UPnP discover
 * request that uses the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). It provides
 * information about a discovered UPnP device.
 *
 * The following is taken from:
 *
 * http://www.upnp.org/download/UPnPDA10_20000613.htm
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * CACHE-CONTROL: max-age = seconds until advertisement expires
 * DATE: when response was generated
 * EXT:
 * LOCATION: URL for UPnP description for root device
 * SERVER: OS/version UPnP/1.0 product/version
 * ST: search target
 * USN: advertisement UUID
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Headers:
 *
 * CACHE-CONTROL
 * Required. Must have max-age directive that specifies number of seconds the
 * advertisement is valid. After this duration, control points should assume
 * the device (or service) is no longer available. Should be > 1800 seconds
 * (30 minutes). Specified by UPnP vendor. Integer.
 *
 * DATE
 * Recommended. When response was generated. RFC 1123 date.
 *
 * EXT
 * Required. Confirms that the MAN header was understood.
 * (Header only; no value.)
 *
 * LOCATION
 * Required. Contains a URL to the UPnP description of the root device. In
 * some unmanaged networks, host of this URL may contain an IP address
 * (versus a domain name). Specified by UPnP vendor. Single URL.
 *
 * SERVER
 * Required. Concatenation of OS name, OS version, UPnP/1.0, product name,
 * and product version. Specified by UPnP vendor. String.
 *
 * ST
 * Required header defined by SSDP. Search Target. Single URI. If ST header
 * in request was,
 *
 * ssdp:all
 * Respond 3+2d+k times for a root device with d embedded devices and s
 * embedded services but only k distinct service types. Value for ST header
 * must be the same as for the NT header in NOTIFY messages with ssdp:alive.
 * (See above.) Single URI.
 *
 * upnp:rootdevice
 * Respond once for root device. Must be upnp:rootdevice. Single URI.
 *
 * uuid:device-UUID
 * Respond once for each device, root or embedded. Must be uuid:device-UUID.
 * Device UUID specified by UPnP vendor. Single URI.
 *
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:deviceType:v
 * Respond once for each device, root or embedded. Must be
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:deviceType:v. Device type and version defined
 * by UPnP Forum working committee.
 *
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:v
 * Respond once for each service. Must be
 * urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:v. Service type and version defined
 * by UPnP Forum working committee.
 *
 * USN
 * Required header defined by SSDP. Unique Service Name. (See list of required
 * values for USN header in NOTIFY with ssdp:alive above.) Single URI.
